# Lean-Tween-Wrapper

A script for Unity projects that wraps Lean Tween functions and settings into a MonoBehaviour so you can easily and quickly add animations to objects without having to create a script for every one of them.

Requires LeanTween for Unity.

Unfortunately, because LeanTween doesn't have its own assembly definition, you cannot install this repo using the package manager. You have to manually add the files to your project.
